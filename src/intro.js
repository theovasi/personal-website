					<p>
						I am a software engineer currently working for a travel software company called Amadeus. There I write
						mainly backend code (C++ and Python) for high-availability mission critical applications that handle
						millions of passengers daily to make air travel possible. One might also catch me doing some frontend
						work primarily using Angular.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am always eager to learn new things around software and I like to work on personal projects to experiment
						with new tools and technologies that interest me and improve. Lately I've been very interested in
						Machine Learning and React.
