					<p>
						I am a software engineer currently working for a travel software company called Amadeus. There I contribute
						to the industry-leading check-in and passenger management system, a mission critical application that handles
						more than a billion passengers a year at 99.99% SLA. Mainly I code in C++ and Python but one ne might also
						catch me doing some frontend work primarily using Angular.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am always eager to learn new things around software and I like to work on personal projects to experiment
						with new tools and technologies that interest me and improve. Lately I've been very interested in
						Machine Learning and React.
